# ERPNext-DATEV_connector

As a result from the ERPNext Event in Wiesbaden, Germany on Nov. 21, 2018 this repositorie's goal is
to develop of a connector or adaptor to exchange accounting data between ERPNext and the DATEV.

DATEV is almost is holding a de facto monlopy in the German market for tax consultancies (Steuerberater) so 
ERPNext users in the Germany may be obligded to provide their accounting data to external consultants
or tax authorities in a format readable by DATEV.

The principles of this work to may apply to other external accounting systems as well though.

I personally am not a developer but aim to get the right group of people together and steer the project 
where needed.

It is still to be decided where in the end the best location of this repository is, but to get things started 
I have put it in my personal github for the time being.
